# bank_customers

This project is my first ever dashboard using google data studio. Visualized in the dashboard is a data set containing details of a bank's customers. This project aim to derived insight from the dataset. in the dataset, the target variable is called exiting and it reflect the fact whether a customer close his/her account. After doing some analysis we found some interesting fact, that is:
- The bank's customers is mostly from France.
- Customers exited the bank is mostly from germany. The number of people closing their account in germany is higher than average
- On Average the bank's customer is in their 20's while people that closed their account is in their mid 50
- From the data we could also see that female customer closed their account more frequently than male
